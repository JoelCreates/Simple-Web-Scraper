# Simple-Web-Scraper
This is a simple web scraper written in Python that demonstrates how to retrieve and extract information from a webpage. It utilizes the `requests` library to send a GET request to a specified URL and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content.

# Features:
- Sends a GET request to a webpage and checks the response status code.
- Prints the webpage content for inspection.
- Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract information.
- Finds the latest five articles on the webpage.
- Scrapes the title and URL of each article and prints them.

# Getting Started:
1. Install the required libraries:
2. Set the `url` variable in the code to the webpage you want to scrape.
3. Run the script and observe the output.

Note: This is a basic example and may require modifications to work with different webpages or handle more complex scenarios. It serves as a starting point for building more robust web scraping applications.
